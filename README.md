# Obsidian Open In New Tab Plugin

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:patleeman/obsidian-open-in-new-tab.git
```

This plugin does two things:

1. In File Explorer, open all documents in a new tab.
2. If the file is already open in an existing tab, make that tab active instead of opening up a new tab.

## How to use

-   Clone this repo.
-   `npm i` or `yarn` to install dependencies
-   `npm run dev` to start compilation in watch mode.

## Releasing new releases

-   Update your `manifest.json` with your new version number, such as `1.0.1`, and the minimum Obsidian version required for your latest release.
-   Update your `versions.json` file with `"new-plugin-version": "minimum-obsidian-version"` so older versions of Obsidian can download an older version of your plugin that's compatible.
-   Create new GitHub release using your new version number as the "Tag version". Use the exact version number, don't include a prefix `v`. See here for an example: https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin/releases
-   Upload the files `manifest.json`, `main.js`, `styles.css` as binary attachments. Note: The manifest.json file must be in two places, first the root path of your repository and also in the release.
-   Publish the release.

> You can simplify the version bump process by running `npm version patch`, `npm version minor` or `npm version major` after updating `minAppVersion` manually in `manifest.json`.
> The command will bump version in `manifest.json` and `package.json`, and add the entry for the new version to `versions.json`

## Adding your plugin to the community plugin list

-   Check https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/blob/master/plugin-review.md

-   Make sure you have a `README.md` file in the root of your repo.
-   Make a pull request at https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases to add your plugin.
